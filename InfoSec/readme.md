Security testing:
Dynamic testing of web applications against major types of attacks: XSS, SQL Injection, buffer overflows, manipulations of the address bar and source code revealing
Intrusion (penetration) tests (access control, authentication, input validation, cryptography reliability, error handling)
Testing of payment mechanisms in different web systems
Vulnerability testing of system's third-party components
Security code audit (use of static code analysis tools, manual review of major components of the system, recommendations on improvements, patches, security alerts)
Server configuration testing (search for errors in multithreaded environments that allow data to be shared or corrupted)
