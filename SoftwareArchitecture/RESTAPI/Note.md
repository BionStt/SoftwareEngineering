# Choosing a Spec
* Choosing the best specification for your companyâ€™s needs will make building, maintaining, documenting and sharing your API easier. 
* Because Spec-Driven Development encourages the use of a well tested, standardized spec, it is highly recommended that you choose from RAML, Swagger, Mashery IO Docs, tripit slate or API Blueprint.
