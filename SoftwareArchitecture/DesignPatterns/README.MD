* **Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture**	Concentrates on Enterprise Application Architecture in the context of a layered architecture. Main sections cover domain logic, web presentations, database interaction, offline concurrency (by David Rice) and distribution. Database interaction is the largest section with many patterns on object-relational mapping issues.
* **Core J2EE Patterns**	Enterprise Application Architecture patterns in the context of the Java J2EE platform. Although the patterns are focused around the J2EE platform, the patterns are usually equally applicable (albeit with a twist) to other enterprise application platforms.
* **Enterprise Integration Patterns**	I've increasingly come to the view that integration through asynchronous messaging is one of the most effective ways to integrate disparate enterprise applications. EIP is a foundation collection of patterns for this approach.
* **Microsoft Enterprise Solution Patterns**	Microsoft's first collection of enterprise software patterns. Sections include patterns on Web Presentation, Deployment, and Distributed Systems.
* **Microsoft Data Patterns**	A collection of patterns on data movement: replication and synchronization.
* Microsoft Integration Patterns	Microsoft's take on integration patterns. Sections cover strategies for an integration layer, approaches to system connections, and topologies for integration.
* **Domain Driven Design**	Building an object-oriented Domain Model is a popular approach to organizing domain logic. It works particularly well with complex domains. It's downside is that it is difficult to do well. These patterns describe how to think about building and structuring a rich domain model, as well as how to recognize and overcome the real-world obstacles that too-often prevent people from employing the modeling principles they know.
* **Analysis Patterns** See enough domain models, and you see certain kinds of structures repeatedly. This book was my attempt to capture these commonalities in the form of patterns. In lots of ways it's very much in need of an update, but the basic ideas are still pretty sound. If find this material useful, do make sure you look at the newer supplementary material that I put on my website.
* **Data Model Patterns**	Common patterns in data models. Since these are developed from a very conceptual approach, the patterns are useful for object modeling as well as data modeling.
* **Gang of Four**	The first, and most used, patterns book. These are mostly fundamental patterns which are not specifically for enterprise software development, but the enterprise patterns reference them widely.
* **POSA**	Particularly influential for its work on architectural patterns. Layers (for enterprise applications) and pipes and filters (for messaging) are foundations for much enterprise patterns work.

# 23 Gang of Four (GoF) 
* Creational Patterns
  * Abstract Factory - Creates an instance of several families of classes
  * Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
  * Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes
  * Prototype	 - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
  * Singleton	- A class of which only a single instance can exist

* Structural Patterns
  * Adapter	- Match interfaces of different classes
  * Bridge	- Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
  * Composite	- A tree structure of simple and composite objects
  * Decorator	- Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
  * Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
  * Flyweight	- A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
  * Proxy	- An object representing another object

* Behavioral Patterns
  * Chain of Resp. - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
  * Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
  * Interpreter -	A way to include language elements in a program
  * Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
  * Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
  * Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
  * Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
  * State	- Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
  * Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
  * Template Method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
  * Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change



# Concurrency Patterns
* Active Object: Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests.
* Balking: Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.
* Binding Properties: Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way.
* Messaging pattern: The messaging design pattern (MDP) allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications.
* Double-checked locking: Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual lock proceed. Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. It can therefore sometimes be considered an anti-pattern.
* Event-based asynchronous: Addresses problems with the Asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.[10]
* Guarded suspension: Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.
* Lock: One thread puts a "lock" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.[11][7]
* Monitor object: An object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.
* Reactor: A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously.
* Read-write lock: Allows concurrent read access to an object but requires exclusive access for write operations.
Scheduler: Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.
* Thread pool: A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be considered a special case of the object pool pattern.
* Thread-specific storage: Static or "global" memory local to a thread.
