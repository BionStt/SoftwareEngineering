Abstract Factory Design Pattern


* Simple Factory: Strictly speaking, it's not a design pattern, but a technique we use very often. It encapsulates the object instantiation process.
* Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object, but let's the classes that implement the interface decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
* Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
