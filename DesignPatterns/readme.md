# 23 Gang of Four (GoF) 
* Creational Patterns
  * Abstract Factory - Creates an instance of several families of classes
  * Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
  * Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes
  * Prototype	 - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
  * Singleton	- A class of which only a single instance can exist

* Structural Patterns
  * Adapter	- Match interfaces of different classes
  * Bridge	- Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
  * Composite	- A tree structure of simple and composite objects
  * Decorator	- Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
  * Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
  * Flyweight	- A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
  * Proxy	- An object representing another object

* Behavioral Patterns
  * Chain of Resp. - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
  * Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
  * Interpreter -	A way to include language elements in a program
  * Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
  * Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
  * Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
  * Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
  * State	- Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
  * Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
  * Template Method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
  * Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change



# Concurrency Patterns
* Active Object: Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests.
* Balking: Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.
* Binding Properties: Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way.
* Messaging pattern: The messaging design pattern (MDP) allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications.
* Double-checked locking: Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual lock proceed. Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. It can therefore sometimes be considered an anti-pattern.
* Event-based asynchronous: Addresses problems with the Asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.[10]
* Guarded suspension: Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.
* Lock: One thread puts a "lock" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.[11][7]
* Monitor object: An object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.
* Reactor: A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously.
* Read-write lock: Allows concurrent read access to an object but requires exclusive access for write operations.
Scheduler: Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.
* Thread pool: A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be considered a special case of the object pool pattern.
* Thread-specific storage: Static or "global" memory local to a thread.
