Why Model Performance?

What are the relevant code paths and how do they affect performance?
Where do the use of resources or computations affect performance?
Which are the most frequently executed code paths? This helps you identify where to spend time tuning.
What are the key steps that access resources and lead to contention?
Where is your code in relation to resources (local, remote)?
What tradeoffs have you made for performance?
Which components have relationships to other components or resources?
Where are your synchronous and asynchronous calls?
What is your I/O-bound work and what is your CPU-bound work?

What is the priority and achievability of different performance goals?
Where have your performance goals affected design?



The performance modeling process involves the following steps:
Identify key scenarios. Identify scenarios where performance is important and scenarios that pose the most risk to your performance objectives.
Identify workload. Identify how many users and concurrent users your system needs to support.
Identify performance objectives. Define performance objectives for each of your key scenarios. Performance objectives reflect business requirements.
Identify budget. Identity your budget or constraints. This includes the maximum execution time in which an operation must be completed and resource utilization constraints, such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network I/O.
Identify processing steps. Break down your key scenarios into component processing steps.
Allocate budget. Spread your budget (determined in Step 4) across your processing steps (determined in Step 5) to meet your performance objectives (defined in Step 3).
Evaluate. Evaluate your design against objectives and budget. You may need to modify your design or spread your response time and resource utilization budget differently to meet your performance objectives.
Validate. Validate your model and estimates. This is an ongoing activity and includes prototyping, assessing, and measuring.
